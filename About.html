            <p>
                <Strong style="font-style: italic;color: #5c7a63">Childhood</Strong> is a small school project shop that
                sells products inspired by Studio Ghibli stories and handmade DIY keychains.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our products are created to bring back the feeling of childhood-soft, magical, and full of imagination.
                Inspired by Ghibli movies,
                we design cute and meaningful items that remind people of simple happiness
                and warm memories.
            </p>

            <p>
                All DIY keychains are carefully made with creative and love. This project was created as part of a
                school assignment to learn about
                creativity, design, and small business ideas.
            </p>
